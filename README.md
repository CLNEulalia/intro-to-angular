## Intro

### 1. Archtecture

> Front-End: UI

Typically built with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, & Angular
HTML Templates & **Presentation Logic**

> Back-End: Data & Processing

Database + APIs
**Business Logic**

### 2. Installing Angular Globally
`npm i -g @angular/cli`

Moving forward, I shouldn't have to reinstall `Angular` every time I want to build an `Angular App`.

### 3. Create App
`ng new app-name`

Not unlike `React`'s `npm create-react-app app-name`

> Will ask "Would you like to add Angular routing"

If initially choosing **No**, can be changed later down the road.

### 4. Run The App
`ng serve`

>Proceed to `localhost:4200` 
>
> I don't know if the localhost's port can be changed, like how we worked on port 3000/4000/42069/etc.

Kinda like `React`'s `npm start` to run the app on local host.
